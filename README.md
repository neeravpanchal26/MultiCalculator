Could not complete this point:
Copy the package declaration out of the Greeting class and paste it to the top of the Calculator class.

Due to my greeting class being generated without it.

Also didn't do commits as I was busy learning to code with andriod studio.

Assignment 3 done as per rubric, only able to test it with preview. Emulator switches on with black screen, so could not debug with live preview.
